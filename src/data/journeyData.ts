    day: 1,
    title: "The First Step",
    reflection: "Today marks the start of your freedom. You've acknowledged that porn is holding you back, and that takes immense courage. Remember: this isn't about losing something—it's about gaining your life back. Every great journey begins with a single step, and today you take yours.",
    activity: "Write down your top 3 reasons for quitting porn. Be specific and personal. Keep this list somewhere you can see it daily—your phone, wallet, or mirror.",
    selfCheck: "How strong are your urges today (scale 1–10)? What situations or emotions triggered them? Notice patterns without judgment.",
    tip: "Install a content blocker app on your devices today. Remove temptation before willpower is tested.",
    milestone: true
  },
  {
    day: 2,
    title: "Replace, Don't Just Remove",
    reflection: "The brain hates a vacuum. If you remove porn, you must replace it with better habits. This is how we rewire our neural pathways—not by forcing emptiness, but by filling the space with purpose and growth.",
    activity: "Pick one replacement habit (reading, exercise, learning an instrument, drawing). Commit to spending at least 20 minutes doing it today. Start small, be consistent.",
    selfCheck: "Did you find yourself bored or restless? How did you handle idle moments? Boredom is often a trigger—what's your plan?",
    tip: "Keep your hands busy during usual 'danger times'. Stress balls, puzzles, or instruments can redirect nervous energy."
  },
  {
    day: 3,
    title: "Understanding Your Triggers",
    reflection: "Recovery isn't about perfection—it's about awareness. Today, become a detective of your own mind. Triggers aren't your enemy; they're information that helps you build stronger defenses.",
    activity: "Create a trigger log. Throughout the day, note when you feel urges. What time? What were you doing? How were you feeling? Look for patterns.",
    selfCheck: "What was your strongest trigger moment today? Did you recognize it in time? How did you respond?",
    tip: "The HALT check: Are you Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired? These states make us vulnerable to all addictions."

  {
    day: 7,
    title: "One Week Strong",
    reflection: "Seven days in! This is where many people stumble, but you're still here. This week you've learned that urges are temporary storms—they come, they peak, and they pass. You are stronger than you think.",
    activity: "Journal about your wins this week. Even small victories count: choosing a book over your phone, taking a cold shower, reaching out to a friend instead of isolating.",
    selfCheck: "What triggers did you encounter this week? Which coping strategies worked best? What caught you off guard?",
    tip: "Share your progress with someone you trust. Accountability isn't about shame—it's about having someone celebrate your victories with you.",
    milestone: true
  },
  {
    day: 14,
    title: "Building New Neural Pathways",
    reflection: "Two weeks of rewiring your brain! Every day you don't use porn, you're literally changing your neural structure. Old pathways weaken while new, healthier ones strengthen. Science is on your side.",
    activity: "Practice a 10-minute mindfulness exercise. Sit quietly, focus on your breathing, and when thoughts arise, simply notice them without judgment. This builds the mental muscle to observe urges without acting.",
    selfCheck: "How has your relationship with boredom changed? Are you getting better at sitting with uncomfortable feelings?",
    tip: "Exercise releases natural endorphins that help combat withdrawal symptoms. Even a 15-minute walk makes a difference.",
    milestone: true
  },
  {
    day: 21,
    title: "Three Weeks of Freedom",
    reflection: "Three weeks! You've proven that change is possible. By now, you might notice improvements in energy, focus, or confidence. These aren't placebo effects—they're real changes happening as your brain recalibrates to a healthier baseline.",
    activity: "Write a letter to yourself from one week ago. What encouragement would you give? What have you learned that you wish you'd known earlier?",
    selfCheck: "What positive changes have you noticed? How do you feel different from three weeks ago?",
    tip: "Celebrate your progress today. Positive reinforcement strengthens new habits. Do something kind for yourself—you've earned it.",
    milestone: true
  },
  {
    day: 30,
    title: "One Month Free",
    reflection: "Congratulations. One full month free from porn. This is a major milestone that proves freedom is not just possible—it's already happening. Notice the improvements in your energy, focus, and relationships. This is who you really are.",
    activity: "Write a letter to yourself 30 days ago. What would you tell your past self who was just starting this journey? What fears did you have that didn't come true?",
    selfCheck: "What's been your hardest trigger so far? How have you learned to deal with it? What strategies serve you best?",
    tip: "Reward yourself meaningfully today. Plan something special that aligns with your values—time in nature, a new book, connecting with loved ones.",
    milestone: true
